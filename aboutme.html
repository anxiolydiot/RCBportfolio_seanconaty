<h1>Education</h1>

I graduated from Rutgers Newark with a B.A. in psychology. During this time, most of my education came from hands on lab work I completed outside of my normal course work. After completeing my Degreee, I completed a "mini MBA" which detailed information on development, marketing, and sales of biopharmacetical products. I am currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
